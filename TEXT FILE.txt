Hello! I'm Maxwell Siamah, a 16-year-old student from Ho, Ghana, currently residing in the Ho-Dome area. Standing at 3.5 feet tall, I am in my second year (Level 200) of tertiary education, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. 

I come from a large family, being one of eight children born to Mr. and Mrs. Siamah. My interests include football and music, which I actively engage in alongside my academic pursuits.

Ho-Dome, my current neighborhood, is one of the five divisions of the Ho Traditional Area, known for its rich cultural heritage and history. 

I am committed to leveraging my education in Information Technology to contribute positively to my community and beyond.
